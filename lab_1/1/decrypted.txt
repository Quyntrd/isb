GUIDO'S KEY IDEA IS THIS: CODE IS READ MANY MORE TIMES THAN IT IS WRITTEN. ESSENTIALLY, CODING STYLE GUIDELINES AIM TO IMPROVE CODE READABILITY AND CONSISTENCY ACROSS LARGE VOLUMES OF PROJECTS. IDEALLY, ALL CODE WILL BE WRITTEN IN THE SAME STYLE, AND ANYONE CAN EASILY READ IT.
THIS GUIDE IS ABOUT CONSISTENCY AND UNITY. CONSISTENCY WITH THIS GUIDANCE IS VERY IMPORTANT. CONSISTENCY WITHIN A PROJECT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT. AND CONSISTENCY WITHIN A MODULE OR FUNCTION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT SOMETIMES THIS GUIDANCE DOES NOT APPLY, AND TO UNDERSTAND WHEN TO DEVIATE FROM THE RECOMMENDATIONS. WHEN IN DOUBT, JUST LOOK AT OTHER EXAMPLES AND DECIDE WHICH ONE LOOKS BETTER.
